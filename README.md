# Voxel-Game

A small real-time 3 D game/engine written in modern C++ and Vulkan.  
It provides the foundations for a voxel or mesh-based world, featuring an ECS-style scene graph, free-fly camera, textured materials, OBJ model loading, and a minimal debug draw pipeline.

---

## ‚ú® Features
‚Ä¢ Vulkan 1.3 renderer using GLFW for window & input.  
‚Ä¢ Physically-inspired material system with push-constants.  
‚Ä¢ Free-fly first-person camera (WASD + mouse).  
‚Ä¢ OBJ + MTL loading via **tinyobjloader**.  
‚Ä¢ Image loading through **stb_image**.  
‚Ä¢ Text rendering with **FreeType2**.  
‚Ä¢ Hot-swappable render commands queue.  
‚Ä¢ Simple scene system for creating game objects, adding meshes, and importing external models.

## üîß Prerequisites
The engine is developed and tested primarily on **Windows 10** with **MinGW-w64** GCC, but it is fully cross-platform as long as the following dependencies are available:

1. **Vulkan SDK ‚â• 1.3** (provides headers, validation layers, `glslc`, ‚Ä¶)
2. **GLFW 3.x** (compiled with Vulkan support)
3. **glm** (header-only maths library)
4. **stb_image.h** (header included locally or system-wide)
5. **tinyobjloader** (header-only ‚Äì included locally or system-wide)
6. **FreeType2**
7. **CMake ‚â• 3.21** (for presets) and **Ninja** generator

> On Windows you can obtain most of these through **MSYS2**:
> ```bash
> pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw mingw-w64-x86_64-glm \
>              mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja
> ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Voxel-Game.git
cd Voxel-Game
```

### 2. Configure the build directory
The project ships with a ready-made **CMake preset** called `default` that targets MinGW & Ninja on Windows:
```bash
cmake --preset default   # generates build/ and compiles compile_commands.json
```
If you prefer another compiler or OS simply replace the generator:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### 3. Build the project
```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```
The resulting binary will be placed in `build/` (e.g. `build/main.exe`).

---

## üé® Compiling the shaders
The two GLSL shaders live in `shaders/`.  A convenience batch script is provided for Windows users:
```powershell
cd shaders
./compile.bat
```
This simply calls `glslc` from the Vulkan SDK and produces `vert.spv` & `frag.spv` which are embedded at runtime.  Linux/macOS users can run the equivalent commands manually:
```bash
glslc shader.vert -o vert.spv
glslc shader.frag -o frag.spv
```
Ensure these SPIR-V files are next to the source GLSL or adjust the paths in `renderer.cpp`.

---

## üöÄ Running the demo
After a successful build just launch the executable:
```bash
./build/main.exe   # or ./build/Voxel-Game on UNIX
```
A window titled "Game Engine" will open and render a simple scene containing:
‚Ä¢ A textured skybox.  
‚Ä¢ A large ground plane.  
‚Ä¢ Two wooden cubes.  
‚Ä¢ A scaled OBJ couch model.

## ‚ûï Extending the engine
Creating a new object from user code (see `src/main.cpp`):
```cpp
Engine engine;
engine.init("My Game", startFn, updateFn);
engine.createGameObject("cube", {0,0,0}, {0,0,0}, {1,1,1});
engine.addMeshToObject("cube", material, "textures/wood.png", cubeVertices, cubeIndices);
```
You can also import any **OBJ/MTL** pair with `Engine::loadModel()` ‚Äì textures referenced in the MTL file will be loaded automatically.
